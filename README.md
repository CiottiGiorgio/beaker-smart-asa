## Beaker Smart ASA

This project aims to be an implementation of a collection of Beaker contracts that are compliant with [ARC-0020](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/ARCs/blob/main/ARCs/arc-0020.md).  
Ideally, we will be able to provide a set of extensible abstract contracts that can be used to implement Smart ASA-specific logic.
