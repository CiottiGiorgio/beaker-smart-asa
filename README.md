## Beaker Smart ASA

This project aims to be an implementation of a collection of Beaker contracts that are compliant with [ARC-0020](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/ARCs/blob/main/ARCs/arc-0020.md).  
Ideally, we will be able to provide a set of extensible abstract contracts that can be used to implement Smart ASA-specific logic.

Existing implementations:
- [algorandlabs](https://github.com/algorandlabs/smart-asa)
- [beaker](https://github.com/algorand-devrel/beaker/blob/36fe1fc24f90f173fd13f8bf748995753caf7420/beaker/contracts/arcs/arc20.py)
